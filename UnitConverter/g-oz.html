        <h2> Brief History of Grams and Ounces </h2>
          <p> Gram (g), also spelled gramme, unit of mass or weight that is used especially in the centimetre-gram-second system of measurement.The gram is very nearly equalo the mass of one cubic centimetre of pure water at 4 Â°C,the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density under normal terrestrial pressures. </p>
          <br/>
          <p> The international avoirdupois ounce (abbreviated oz) is defined as exactly 28.349523125 g under the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, signed by the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. In the avoirdupois system, sixteen ounces make up an avoirdupois pound, and the avoirdupois pound is defined as 7000 grains; one avoirdupois ounce is therefore equal to 437.5 grains. The ounce is still a standard unit in the United States. In the United Kingdom it ceased to be a legal unit of measure in 2000, but is still in general usage on an informal basis and also as the indicator of portion sizes in restaurants.</p>
